# Secure Login Page Development

## Objective
To develop a secure login page that incorporates proper authentication and session management practices to ensure user data security and integrity.

## Project Description
This project focuses on building a secure login system designed to protect user credentials and manage sessions effectively. The key security features include:

- **Authentication:** Implemented using robust hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) to encrypt passwords and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Session Management:** Secure handling of session cookies to maintain user authentication without exposing sensitive information.
- **SQL Injection Prevention:** Use of prepared statements to mitigate the risk of SQL injection attacks.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:** Input validation and escaping user inputs to prevent malicious scripts from running on the site.
- **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data is encrypted during transmission using HTTPS to ensure confidentiality.

## Features
- Secure login and registration system
- Password hashing and verification
- Input validation and sanitization
- Prevention of common web vulnerabilities
- Session management with secure cookies

## Technologies Used
- **PHP** for server-side scripting
- **MySQL** for database management
- **HTML, CSS** for front-end design
- **JavaScript** for client-side validation

## Installation
